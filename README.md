# Health Tracker

The Health Tracker is the first Android app that I am developing.  It emulates a Health app by focusing on things like exercise, but mainly it is a platform to learn how to develop an Android app.

## Lab 26 Features

* Added a button that can be tapped and a counter will display how many taps the user has made.  Encouraging messages will be displayed as the count get higher.
* A stopwatch was added to the main view, with start, stop, and reset buttons.  The stopwatch starts at 0:00:00.000 and goes up to 0:00:00.000.
* Image carousel was added which display different exercise-themed images.
